# connectify-android-app

A walkie-talkie Android application template, I developed and optimized for a beta release. Although it is not stable yet, it works by transmitting your recorded voice through a Wi-Fi connection to another peer. Please, feel free to look through the sourcecode or even run the app in your android device or emulator; an apk is provided.

Kind regards,

Younes
